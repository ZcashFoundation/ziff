# ziff

Diff the **public API** and **dependencies** of a Rust workspace's crates
between two git refs — and flag the changes that are breaking for downstream
consumers.

`ziff` wraps [`cargo public-api`](https://github.com/cargo-public-api/cargo-public-api)
and adds workspace-wide dependency, lockfile, and const/value diffing on top, so
a single command tells you whether a branch breaks your published surface.

## What it reports

1. **Workspace dependency diff** — each dep classified by the strongest kind it
   is used with (runtime > build > dev); consumer-visible breaking changes
   (runtime removals, major bumps, lost features) are highlighted.
2. **Transitive `Cargo.lock` diff** (`--with-lock`) — transitive version changes,
   each annotated with the direct deps that pull it in.
3. **Per-crate public-API diff** (`cargo public-api`) — removed / changed / added
   items per workspace crate. Built with `--all-features` so feature-gated public
   items are never silently missed.
4. **Const/static value & doc-comment diff** (`--with-values`) — catches changes
   `cargo public-api` can't see, since it compares signatures only.

It ends with a `BREAKING` / `ERROR` / `OK` verdict (and a `--json` mode for CI).

## Install

First install the prerequisites (see [Requirements](#requirements)):

```sh
cargo install cargo-public-api    # required; jq is also required
```

Then get `ziff` itself — it's a single Bash script. Install it onto your `PATH`:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZcashFoundation/ziff/main/ziff -o ~/.local/bin/ziff && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/ziff
```

…or run a one-off without installing:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZcashFoundation/ziff/main/ziff | bash -s -- main
```

In CI, the download-then-run form is the most robust:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZcashFoundation/ziff/main/ziff -o ziff
chmod +x ziff
./ziff "$BASE".."$HEAD" --json
```

> When run via `curl … | bash`, `--help` shows only a short usage (the script
> can't re-read its own source from a pipe); install it to a file for the full
> reference.

## Usage

```sh
ziff                       # dirty tree: HEAD -> working tree; clean: parent-branch -> HEAD
ziff main                  # compare against main (-> working tree if dirty, else HEAD)
ziff v4.1.0 v4.2.0         # compare two arbitrary refs
ziff --fetch               # fetch the upstream main tip first, then diff against it
ziff --with-lock           # include the transitive Cargo.lock diff
ziff --with-values main    # also flag const/static value + doc changes
ziff --json main           # machine-readable output for CI
ziff --changelog main      # draft a librustzcash-style changelog (markdown)
```

Run `ziff --help` for the full option and output reference.

### `--changelog`

`--changelog` drafts a [librustzcash](https://github.com/zcash/librustzcash)/Zebra-style
changelog (markdown) instead of the diff: one `## <crate>` section per changed
crate, with `### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Removed` lists.

- Added/removed API items are grouped under their owning type, with own-crate
  paths made crate-relative (e.g. `error::TransactionError`) and foreign-type
  paths kept in full. Several members of one type are brace-grouped onto a single
  bullet, lrz-style: `` - `OutPoint::{NULL, new, read, write}` ``.
- Changed items show the old → new signature, so the entry says *what* changed
  (e.g. a return type going from `Result<Self, E>` to `Self`) rather than just
  naming the item.
- Trait-impl associated items are grouped under an `impl <Trait> for <Self>`
  header. The trait is recovered from the crate's rustdoc JSON (so even a
  *changed* associated type like `ValueBalance::Bytes`, whose `impl` line is
  unchanged and thus absent from the diff, is attributed correctly), and the
  Self generics are recovered from the signature. A trait implemented on several
  types collapses to one `` `impl Trait` for: `` block listing the types.
- Dependency changes are folded into each crate's section: an MSRV
  (`rust-version`) bump and internal workspace bumps
  (`` `zebra-chain` dependency bumped to `10.0.0`. ``) and external migrations
  (`` Migrated to `zcash_primitives 0.27`. ``) under `### Changed`, dropped deps
  under `### Removed`.

It's a *draft* — review and curate before committing. Needs a `nightly`
toolchain for the trait attribution (without one it falls back to plain
type grouping).

### `--fetch`

`--fetch[=<remote>]` pins the baseline to the *current* tip of a remote branch
instead of a possibly-stale local one, so a comparison isn't fooled by upstream
having moved on. If the fetch can't run (offline, or no SSH auth in a
non-interactive shell), it falls back to the last-synced `<remote>/<branch>`
tracking ref and warns with that ref's commit age.

## Requirements

- Bash 4+ (associative arrays)
- [`cargo-public-api`](https://github.com/cargo-public-api/cargo-public-api)
- `jq`
- a `nightly` toolchain — only for `--with-values` and `--changelog`

## Exit codes

- `0` — no breaking changes (additive changes are fine)
- `1` — breaking changes detected, `cargo public-api` failed for a crate, or a
  runtime error
